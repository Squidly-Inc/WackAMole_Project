# Wack A Moll Project
## By: Evan Brannigan

#### This project is basically the same as the sample Wack a Moll project we did a while ago. I have had no time to work on a project better than this due to the move.
#### The biggest difference between the two games is that I added a start button and reset button, as mentioned in the criteria. 
#### This project is a resubmission because I started by working on a Snake project but that turned into a train wreck due to my move.
#### I will have to just suffer the grade on this project this time because I have to balance my time very carefully these days as I am spread very thin.
#### I can assure you my future work will be much better as I will soon have much more time to work on these project.

#### I truly appreciate your understanding on this matter. I apologize that I cannot turn in better work this time.
#### Evan Brannigan
